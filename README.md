# Airport challenge in Javascript

This is a Javascript project I wrote during Week 5 at Makers Academy.
The task was to write a software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.
I test drove the creation of a set of classes in this project with Jasmine.
